Machine learning project analyzing polar lowes and cloud obstructions.

This repository showcases the machine learning models my team and I created to recognize certain cloud types and polar lowes.
  - In the obstruction model, I analyze how a TensorFlow model recognizes obstructions in NASA Globe images. The purpose of this notebook is to understand the threshold which obstructions truly distort the model's ability to recognize a cloud type from an image.
  - In other notebooks, we create a model to recognize polar lowes. The purpose of this notebook is to create a more accurate method of predicting highly unpredictable polar lows.
